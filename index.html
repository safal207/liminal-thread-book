          <h2>What is this book?</h2>
          <p>
            The Liminal Thread is the foundational text of the LIMINAL
            philosophy — a way of thinking about human consciousness, AI
            systems and technical architecture through states, transitions and
            resonance.
          </p>
          <p>
            It weaves together deep-tech infrastructure (like the L-THREAD /
            Liminal Transport Protocol (LTP)), emotional computing and
            practical tools for living in a world where our inner states and
            machine cognition are tightly coupled.

        <div>
          <h2>Why this book matters now</h2>
          <p>
            We are crossing a threshold where AI is no longer a tool but a
            partner in cognition. Yet most of our infrastructure was built for
            documents, transactions and short-lived requests.
          </p>
          <p>
            We still talk to AI through channels that were never designed for
            continuity, emotional state or evolving identity. The result is a
            deep mismatch between what these systems could be and what we
            allow them to become.
          </p>
          <p>
            This book is written for that liminal decade — for the people who
            feel that “more speed” is not the answer, and who are ready to
            design systems around relationship, not just computation.

          <p>
            Alex is a QA engineer and systems architect who has spent more
            than a decade inside high-load trading platforms and real-time
            infrastructures. LIMINAL grew out of a simple tension: existing
            systems could process transactions, but not states, transitions or
            emotions.
          </p>
          <p>
            This book is written from the overlap of three worlds: deep-tech
            engineering, inner work, and long-term thinking about where humans
            and AI are actually heading.
